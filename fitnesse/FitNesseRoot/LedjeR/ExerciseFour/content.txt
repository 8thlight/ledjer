Ledger uses only Transaction
Introduce asStatement() in Transaction and use it in Ledger.statement()

pay() and deposit() take a Transaction as an argument. Payments and deposits are stored in the same data structure.

Maybe have a test that adds: deposit, payment, deposit. Ensure the statement shows them in the order that they are entered.

A statement for a ledger displays each deposit on a separate line. The total is shown on the last line of the statement.
