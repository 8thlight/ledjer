Ledger uses only Transaction
Introduce printString() for statement()

pay() and deposit() take a Transaction as an argument. Payments and deposits are stored in the same data structure.

Maybe have a test that adds: deposit, payment, deposit. Ensure the statement shows them in the order that they are entered.
